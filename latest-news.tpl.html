    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The nation&rsquo;s giant credit reporting agencies - which keep records on more than 200 million individuals and influence their ability to obtain credit - have agreed to overhaul their approach to fixing errors and their treatment of medical  debts on consumers&rsquo; reports.</p>

  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/eric_t_schneiderman/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Eric T. Schneiderman.">Eric T. Schneiderman</a>, the New York State attorney general, announced  Monday that his office had reached a sweeping settlement with the agencies, affecting consumers nationwide, which was prompted by an investigation that began in 2012.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Credit reports touch every part of our lives,&rdquo; Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. &ldquo;They affect whether we can obtain a credit card, take out a college loan, rent an apartment or buy a car - and sometimes even whether we can get jobs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The  credit bureaus -&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/experian-plc/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More information about Experian PLC">Experian</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/equifax_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More information about Equifax Inc">Equifax</a>&nbsp;and TransUnion - have long been criticized for the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/your-money/credit-scores/credit-bureaus-willing-to-tolerate-errors-experts-say.html?ref=business&amp;pagewanted=all">convoluted process&nbsp;</a>that consumers must  endure to get their&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/how-to-dispute-credit-report-errors-2/?_r=0">credit reports fixed</a>, among other things. Under the agreement, they will improve their dispute resolution process, which is&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/your-money/credit-scores/15credit.html">largely automated</a>, and instead use specially trained employees.</p>

  <p>The  three companies will also establish a six-month waiting period before reporting  medical debts on consumers&rsquo;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/credit/credit-scores/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about credit scores.">credit  reports</a>, providing more time for consumers to resolve issues that  might amount only to a delayed <a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/insurance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about insurance.">insurance</a>&nbsp;payment or another dispute. The credit agencies will also remove medical debts from an individual&rsquo;s report after the debt is paid by <a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/insurance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about insurance.">insurance</a>.</p>

  <p>Additionally,  the credit reporting bureaus will take steps to make consumers aware that their&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/credit/credit-scores/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about credit scores.">credit reports</a>&nbsp;are available free at least once a year from each of the credit agencies through the website <a target="_blank" href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com/" title="annualcreditreport.com">annualcreditreport.com</a>. The agencies will now  have to include links to that website on their home pages, as well as provide  another free report to consumers who experience a change in their credit  reports after initiating a dispute.</p>

  <p>The  settlement requires the agencies to introduce the changes, which the bureaus  said would be instituted nationwide, over three years. But most changes will be  carried out over the next six to 18 months, according to the Consumer Data  Industry Association, a trade group that represents the credit bureaus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In today&rsquo;s  world, the consumer&rsquo;s input is less important than the bank or collector&rsquo;s  input,&rdquo; said John Ulzheimer, credit expert at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://creditsesame.com/">CreditSesame.com</a>,  adding that the credit agencies always take the companies&rsquo; word over  consumers&rsquo;. &ldquo;The attorney general&rsquo;s settlement changes that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The  investigation was initiated after several New Yorkers complained that they were  having trouble correcting errors on their reports. The credit agencies&rsquo;  industry group said that the three companies had been working with the New York  attorney general and other state attorneys general to develop the plan, and  that more announcements could be made in the months ahead.</p>

  <p>The  credit agencies fully cooperated with the investigation and deny any  wrongdoing, according to the settlement agreement. And though a financial  payment was not required, the reporting agencies will have to spend significant  sums on personnel and on enhancing their systems to adhere to the settlement  agreement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They  are going to have to hire a lot of people,&rdquo; Mr. Schneiderman said at a news  conference on Monday afternoon. &ldquo;It is going to cost a substantial amount.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Credit  reports touch nearly every aspect of a consumer&rsquo;s financial life: Data in the  files is analyzed and used to create credit scores, including the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/22/your-money/credit-scores/free-fico-credit-scores-options-grow-for-consumers.html">FICO score</a>, which is widely used by financial  services companies to judge consumers and decide how much interest to charge  them. But the reports&rsquo; impact can reach far beyond the world of loans; they can  affect an individual&rsquo;s ability to obtain a rental apartment or get a cellphone,  and even influence how much they might pay for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/insurance/auto-insurance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about auto insurance.">car  insurance</a>.</p>

  <p>Even  though consumers are entitled to dispute any inaccurate information in their  credit reports, the entire process has been criticized by consumer advocates  for years: The bureaus often outsource thousands of disputes daily to workers  overseas who generally are told to translate the problem into a two- or  three-digit code that is fed into a computer; the code and any documentation  are sent to the creditor. If the creditor verifies the information, no further  investigation takes place.</p>

  <p>Now,  those automatic rejections will no longer be tolerated. And specially trained  employees will have to review all supporting documentation submitted by  consumers involving mixed credit files - in which a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/your-money/credit-scores/credit-bureaus-willing-to-tolerate-errors-experts-say.html">consumers&rsquo; file is blended with another</a>&nbsp;person&rsquo;s  report - fraud or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/credit/identity-theft/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about identity theft.">identity  theft</a>.</p>

  <p>Requiring  the credit bureaus to wait 180 days to list any delinquent medical debt on  credit reports is another victory for consumers. Given the complex way in which  medical bills are charged and paid, it is not uncommon for delays in payment to  tarnish credit reports, often without consumers&rsquo; knowledge. Just last year, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released the results of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-study-finds-medical-debt-overly-penalizes-consumer-credit-scores/" title="The study.">its own study</a>, based  on five million anonymous credit records, which found that consumers may be  overly penalized for medical debts that go to collections. About half of unpaid  collections on consumers&rsquo; reports are medical-related.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too  many people are surprised to learn of medical billing problems only after  having a bill sent to collection and being forced to deal with damaged credit,&rdquo;  said Mark Rukavina, a longtime consumer advocate and principal of Community  Health Advisors, a consultancy that works with nonprofit hospitals on billing  and collection issues. &ldquo;Having the agencies finally agree to remove medical  debts that were reported and subsequently paid by insurers is long overdue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/your-money/credit-scores-could-rise-with-ficos-new-model.html">FICO</a>&nbsp;has already also acknowledged that  delinquent medical debts may not be an accurate predictor of a consumer&rsquo;s  financial behavior. Last year, it said the latest version of its credit score would  no longer weigh medical debts as heavily as in previous iterations.</p>
  <p>The  settlement - which requires the bureaus to carry out a media campaign  explaining many of the changes over three years - also prohibits collection  companies from reporting items that did not arise from a contract or an  agreement to pay, including items like fines or tickets.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The  settlement is a huge victory that will benefit consumers,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nclc.org/about-us/chi-chi-wu.html">Chi  Chi Wu</a>, a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center. &ldquo;Of course,  making sure that the credit bureaus comply with the agreement will be another  task.&rdquo;</p>
