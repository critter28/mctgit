		<p><strong>Sounds great! But what are the next steps?</strong></p>
		<p>The first step is to position your application for rent to own, to be as desirable as possible for any landlord/seller. The cornerstone 
		to your application is your credit score. If your score is below minimum guidelines (640 for most loans and 620 for FHA) you will need 
		to develop a documentable plan to raise your score. The person who you are working with on obtaining your property has an affiliate 
		relationship with <strong><a href ng-click="navigate.setPage('home')">www.mycreditteam.com</a></strong>. They are experts 
		in the credit restoration and enhancement industry who not only will work on your behalf to raise your score but will also keep the 
		landlord/seller up to date as to the progress of your credit enhancement process.</p>
		<p> If you have not enrolled in credit restoration and your score is below 640 your application for a rent to own property may not be taken 
		seriously since there is no plan in place to position your credit score to be in the range acceptable for a mortgage loan.</p>
		<p><strong>What is required to qualify for a lease purchase property?</strong></p>
		<p>Great question!! When you apply for a lease purchase property, there are some main items that are being reviewed and that are being 
		looked for:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>A Down payment - amount to be agreed upon by you and the landlord/seller</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Debt to Income Ratio Analysis - We will make certain the lease/mortgage payments are within your budget and meet underwriting 
			guidelines. For this step you will need to provide your income documentation</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Credit report score to be above minimum underwriting standards or you must be enrolled in credit restoration / enhancement with 
			My Credit Team.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The total amount required for move in is the Option Fee plus the first month's payment. It's that easy! The first step to 
		accomplishing your goal of home ownership begins by talking with Screen The Tenant.<strong>
